# Peter Bowman Dotfiles

Honestly this will be an unclean mess of things, but the name basically explains everything in the title, its my dotfiles :)

## TO-DO

### Neovim

- Move the nvim configs into their own repo, they're getting big enough that they need to!
- Get telescope configured how you like it
  -  Get telescope file-browser configured properly too
- Figure out how to use the DAP


### Compatibility

- Figure out how to make this work with Ubuntu, Fedora, Mac, and Arch at least, as well as options for WSL
