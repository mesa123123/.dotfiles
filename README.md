# Peter Bowman Dotfiles

Honestly this will be an unclean mess of things, but the name basically explains everything in the title, its my dotfiles :)

## TO-DO

### Neovim

- Move the nvim configs into their own repo, they're getting big enough that they need to!
- Lua-Snips need to be up to code too!
- Setup Editor Config options


### Compatibility

- Figure out how to make this work with Ubuntu, Fedora, Mac, and Arch at least, as well as options for WSL
